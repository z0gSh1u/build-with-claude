      "task_description": "Write a compact, concise 1 day meal plan for a single athlete",
      "scenario": "Testing with a endurance athlete (marathon runner) requiring high carbohydrate intake and specific pre/during/post-workout nutrition timing across morning, afternoon, and evening training sessions"
    },
    "score": 7,
    "reasoning": "The solution comprehensively meets all three mandatory requirements with clear daily totals, macronutrient breakdowns, and detailed meal specifications including portions and timing. The meal plan is compact, practical, and respects all dietary restrictions (vegetarian, nut-free). It successfully addresses all three training sessions with appropriate pre/post-workout nutrition. However, the carbohydrate intake of 5.8g/kg falls below the stated criterion of 8-10g/kg for endurance training, though it remains reasonable for the specific training described. The solution demonstrates strong practical application but has a minor gap in meeting the secondary criterion's upper carbohydrate target."
